A repository that contains the source code for my Final Project for my BSc Computer Science Degree.

This project development began in Early 2023 and ended in late 2023, to satisfy my degree requirements.
Some of the code, assets and visuals, may not be impressive due to the scale and scope of the project. But I'm confident it's good enough!
This is a mere 2% of my power.

This project makes use of Elements casually seen in the Gaming Industry, Such as:
- Procedural and Random Generation of levels
- Basic Fun Mechanics
- Graphics | Animation | Lighting and PostFX
- Physics and Particle Simulation
- Tricks in Game Development
- and Much more.
